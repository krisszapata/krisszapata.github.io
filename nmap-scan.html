      <h1>Local Network Port Scan with Nmap</h1>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        I targeted my router to identify any open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities. The goal was to understand basic network enumeration.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Did</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Used Nmap’s -sV scan to detect open ports and service versions on the router.</li>
        <li>Interpreted scan results, including identification of services like DNS, HTTP, and UPnP.</li>
        <li>Verified filtered ports (such as Telnet and SSH) to assess the security posture of the network.</li>
        <li>Confirmed router responded to ping (ICMP), suggesting it’s discoverable on the network.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Learned how to use Nmap for basic scanning and service fingerprinting.</li>
        <li>Gained experience interpreting scan outputs and identifying potential risks.</li>
        <li>Recognized the importance of router hardening, such as disabling UPnP and ensuring unused ports are closed.</li>
      </ul>
